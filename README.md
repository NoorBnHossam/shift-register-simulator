# Shift Register Simulator 🤹

Welcome to the Shift Register Simulator! This Streamlit application allows you to visualize and simulate various types of shift operations on binary registers. Whether you're a student studying computer architecture or an enthusiast exploring digital systems, this tool will help you understand shift registers in a fun and interactive way.

## Features ✨

- **Right Shift ➡️**: Shift the bits of a register to the right.
- **Left Shift ⬅️**: Shift the bits of a register to the left.
- **Circular Right Shift 🔁**: Perform a circular shift of the register bits to the right.
- **Circular Left Shift 🔁**: Perform a circular shift of the register bits to the left.
- **History Display 📜**: Option to display the history of shifts for better understanding.

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Right Shift**:

   - Enter the initial value of the register (binary).
   - Select the input value (0 or 1) to shift into the register.
   - Choose the number of shifts.
   - (Optional) Check "Show History" to display the history of shifts.
   - Click "Calculate 🧮" to see the result.

2. **Left Shift**:

   - Enter the initial value of the register (binary).
   - Select the input value (0 or 1) to shift into the register.
   - Choose the number of shifts.
   - (Optional) Check "Show History" to display the history of shifts.
   - Click "Calculate 🧮" to see the result.

3. **Circular Shift**:
   - Enter the initial value of the register (binary).
   - Choose the type of shift (Right or Left).
   - Enter the number of shifts.
   - (Optional) Check "Show History" to display the history of shifts.
   - Click "Shift" to see the result.
